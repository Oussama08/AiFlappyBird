# AiFlappyBird

Flappy Bird played by an Ai , developed by Python , using NEAT .

# What NEAT needs :

Inputs ( in our case it's the bird elevation , and the Pipes )

Outputs ( Jump or not )

Activation function ( We're gonna use Tanh function )

Population size ( I Set the population on 50 birds in the beginning , but you can play with That in the Config File ^^ )

Fitness Function ( it's How the Birds are going to react and Grow their intelligence.)

Max Generations ( We put a limit where the Ai should Stop trying , works in the complex situations , so we're cool ^^ )
